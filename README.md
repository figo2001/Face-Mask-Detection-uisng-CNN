1. Dataset Preparation
Gather a labeled dataset containing images of people with and without face masks.
Annotate the images to indicate the presence or absence of masks.

2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture
Design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification tasks.
Common CNN architectures like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet can be used as a starting point.
The last few layers of the network should be adjusted to match the number of classes (with mask, without mask).

3. Data Augmentation
Augment the dataset using techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase its diversity.
This helps the model generalize better to different scenarios and variations in real-world images.

4. Model Training
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Train the CNN model using the training set while validating its performance on the validation set.
Adjust hyperparameters and model architecture based on validation performance.

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on the testing set to assess its generalization to unseen data.
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be used to measure the model's performance.

6. Deployment
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to real-world applications.
Integrate the model into systems that can process images or video streams for face mask detection.

7. Real-time Inference
Use the deployed model for real-time inference on images or video frames to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks or not.

8. Continuous Improvement
Periodically retrain the model with updated datasets to improve its performance over time.
Stay informed about advancements in CNN architectures and computer vision techniques to enhance the model further.
Face mask detection using CNNs is a practical application with implications for public health and safety, allowing automated monitoring of compliance with face mask guidelines in various settings.
