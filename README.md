### 1) Dataset Collection and Annotation:
Gather a diverse dataset containing images of individuals with and without face masks.
Annotate the images to indicate the presence or absence of masks, creating a labeled dataset for training.

### 2) CNN Architecture:
Design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification tasks.
Common architectures include VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet, often modified or customized for the specific face mask detection task.
The final layers of the network are adapted to output probabilities for two classes: "with mask" and "without mask."

###3) Data Augmentation:
Augment the dataset through techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to increase its variability.
Data augmentation helps the model generalize better to diverse scenarios and appearances.

### 4) Model Training:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the CNN model on the training set and validate its performance on the validation set.
Adjust hyperparameters and fine-tune the model architecture based on performance metrics.

### 5) Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model on the test set to assess its generalization to unseen data.
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used to measure the model's effectiveness.

### 6) Deployment:
Deploy the trained model in real-world applications, integrated into systems that process images or video streams.
Real-time inference is performed to detect the presence or absence of face masks on individuals.
### 7) Continuous Improvement:
Periodically update the model with new data to adapt to changing conditions and improve its accuracy.
Stay informed about advancements in CNN architectures and computer vision techniques for potential enhancements.
